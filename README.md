# What is this about?

This is a data engineering project simulating a scenario where we fetch weather data from WeatherStack API and store it in SQL DB where it can be used for analysis or other downstream consumptions.

*Tech Stack: Docker, Python, PostgreSQL, Airflow, and Git.*

Maybe it will help new data engineers to see how all this tools and concepts connect. A YouTube video should be available about this later.

Let's go.
